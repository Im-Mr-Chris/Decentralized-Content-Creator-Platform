# Decentralized-Content-Creator-Platform
Music artists, public speakers, authors, content creators can get anonymous feedback on their content.


a digital paper

ok guys, so I'm pretty new at this so give me a bit to find my place.

I have this idea...


As a music producer or a content creator overall, I've always had a ton of trouble getting feedback on my stuff.  Whether it be music tracks, code, or whatever projects I was working on at the time.  


No thumbs up or down...we're done with that.


Fire
.
.
Ice


That's the new system.


All feeback is annonymous from users that are also annonymous.
This allows for a no judgement zone.

Actually, I'm thinking that the fire and ice should be interchangeable to the content, chosen by the user.
Yes user, we don't mine data here.  We should post this data publicly so everyone else in the space can use these statistics in their own studies rather than having endless rabbit holes to go down.  


Each user should have it's place in the system.  I'm assuming 1xn, 2xn, etc...

How do we keep this from being held by one central entity?  
Is it acceptable to charge only for the transaction?  I mean...I still have a day job lol. 55 hrs a week and this is already difficult.  Imagine if things actually picked up?

We also need a mobile app that integrates with a debit/credit card.  
The credit option needs to be handled by smart contracts.


I'm trying to scale decentralization in my mind atm....How can we be full blown decentralized and still not be vulnerable to the 51% attack?
